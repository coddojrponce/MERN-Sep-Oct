## What to prepare for

### You will be given a wireframe

- Look at the wireframe to determine the data needed for your app
- Look at the sticky notes and list at the bottom of the page
- Black vs Orange Belt requirements are CLEARLY identified

### Client (React - Frontend)

1. Minimal CSS effort
2. Display ALL documents in a collection
3. Display all details for a single document
4. Create a new document
5. Edit an existing document (with a pre-filled form using current values)
6. Use react-router-dom routing to go to each different front-end page (link, navigate, Router)
7. Display custom validations (from the backend response)

### Server (Node / Express / Mongo - Backend)

1. Restful API (API routes are called from the front end using Axios)
2. CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
3. Reads can return a single document or all documents depending on the route
4. Data Validation in the model (mongoose schema) - including "custom" error responses

### You can reuse pieces of your own code!

- How much would really need to change on the backend?
- Feel free to create a foundation prior to starting your exam. when we send out the exam code, you will also get a list of requirements. You can code a lot before even putting in your code and "officially" starting the exam.
